# 助动词


## 助动词简介
先看下面的例子。

|           |             |           |                |
| --------: | ----------- | --------- | -------------- |
| I         | **have**    | **lost**  | my keys        |
| She       | **can't**   | **come**  | to the party   |
| The hotel | **was**     | **built** | ten years ago. |
| Where     | **did** you | **live**? |                |

在上面四个示例中， **have/can't/was/did** 这四个是助动词。

### 使用助动词可以避免重复前面句子的内容。
示例：
1. "Have you locked the door?" **->** "Yes, I **have**". (= I have locked the door.)
2. Geoge wasn't working but Janet **was**. ( = Jannet was working.)
3. She could lend me the money but she **won't**. (= she won't lend me the money).
4. "Are you angry with me?" **->** "Of course, **I'm not**". (= I'm not angry)
   
   
### 一般现在时和一般过去时句子中可用 **do/does/did**
1. "Do you like onions?" **->** "**Yes,I do**." (= I like onions.)
2. "Does Mark smoke?" **->** "He **did** but he **doesn't** anymore."
   

## **have you?/isn't she?/do they?**
在别人陈述完某一件事之后，我们一般可以使用上面这三种简单的语句。比较礼貌的表示我们对此表示关注。比如：

1. "I've just met Simon." **->** "Oh,have you? How is he?"
2. "Lisa isn't very well today." **->** "Oh,isn't she? What's wrong with her?"
3. "It rained everyday during our holiday." **->** "Did it? What a pity!”

 这种简单问句也可以用来表示惊讶。如：

1. "Jim and Nora are getting married." **->** "Are they? Really?"
   
## 助动词与 **so** 和 **neither** 连用

1. “I'm feeling tired.” **->** "**So am I**." (=I'm feeling tired too)
2. "I never read newspapers." **->** "**Neither do I**." (=I never read newspaper either)
3. Sue hasn't got a car and neither has Martin.

注意 **so** / **neither** 后面主动词与主语的位置。
1. I passed the exam and so did Tom. (而不是 "so Tom did")
   

### **neither** 的其他表达方式
1. 可以使用 **nor** 来替代 **neither**
   
    例如:
        "I can't remember his name." -> "**Nor** can **I**" 或 “**Neither** can **I**.”

2. 也可以使用 **...not...eighter**
   
    例如:
        "I haven't got any money." **->** "**Neither** have **I**." 或 "**I** have**n't** **either**" 或 "**Nor** have **I**".

## **I think so/I hope so**
在一些回答句的场景中，可以使用 **so** 来避免重复。
如：

1. "Are those people English?" **->** "**I think so**." (=I think they are English.)
2. "Will you be at home tomorrow morning?" **->** "**I expect so.**" (= I expect I'll be at home...)
3. "Do you think Kate has been invited to the party?" **->** "**I suppose so.**"
   
其他短句: **I hope so/I guess so/I afraid so**

对应的否定形式如下：
1. I think so/I expect so -> **I don't think so/ I dont'expect so**
2. I hope so/I'm afraid so/I guess so -> **I hope not/ I'm afraid not/I guess not**
3. I suppose so -> **I don't suppose so** 或 **I suppose not**
   
例句：
1. "Is that woman America?" -> "**I think so/I don't think so**
2. "Do you think it's going to rain?" -> "**I hope so/I hope not**." （不要说 "I don't hope so"）
