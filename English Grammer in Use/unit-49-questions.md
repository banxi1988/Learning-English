# 问句 （2）

## 问句作为一个长句的一部分

当问句作为 **Could you tell me ...**/ **Do you know...**/ **I don't know...** 的子句时。

1.  助动词与主语的顺序不需要发生变化 。
    示例：

    - What time **is it**? -> Do you know what time **it is**?
    - Who **is that woman**? -> I don't know who **that women is**.
    - Where **can I** find Linda? -> Can you tell me where **I can** find Linda?
    - How much **will it** cost? -> Have you any idea how much **it will** cost?.

2.  没有助动词时，也不再需要添加 **do/does/did** 等助动词。
    示例：

    - What time **does the film begin**? -> Do you know what time **the film begin?**
    - What **do you mean**? -> Please explain what **you mean**.
    - Why **did Ann leave** early? -> I wonder why **Ann left** early.

3.  没有一般疑问词(**what,why** 等)时使用 **if/whether** 引导。
    - Did any body see you? -> Do you know If/Whether anybody saw you?

##  问句作为引述式句子的一部分

也不需要变换顺序,并且动词经常需要变换为过去式。

- _直述_ The police officer said to us, 'Where **are you going**?'
- _引述_ The police officer asked to us where **we were going**?
- _直述_ Clare said,'What time **do the banks close**'?
- _引述_ Clare wanted to know what time **the banks closed**.

比如你参加  一个面试，面试官问了你如下问题。

1. How old **are you**?
2. What **do you do** in your spare time?
3. How long **have you** been working in your present job?
4. Why **did you apply** for the job?
5. **Can you** speak any foreign languages?
6. **Have you got** a driving licence?

那你在像别人  引述面试  官问你的问题时可以这样表达 。

1.  She asked (me) how old **I was**.
2.  She wanted to know what **I did** in my spare time.
3.  She asked (me) how long **I had** been working in my present job.
4.  She asked (me) why **I had** applied for the job.(or ...why I applied)
5.  She wanted to know whether(or if) **I could** speak any foreign languages.
6.  She asked whether(or if) **I had** a driving licence. (or ...**I had got...**)
